    "Q:1.Explain the key features of Python that make it a popular choice for programming0\n",
    "A: Python is one of the leading programming languages in the world for several reason. They are listed as follows:\n",
    "1. Easy to learn and write- Compared to other programming languages, python is easy to understand as it is very easy to the english Language, which encourages many beginners to learn. Without having complex steps, Python has become the number 1 choice for programmers and developers. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Vast active coomunity- There is a vast community of active python users who continously help and update the data libraries like NumPy, Pandas, etc helping beginners to get a better understanding of the language and have many examples to refer to.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extensive data library- Python has an extensive data library which means it reduces the time to write a code from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Open Source- Python is free to use by any one across the world. The codes or the potentials of Python are not just limited to a selected community.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Versatality- Python as a language is versatile and it has its implementation is various spheres such as AI, Automation, Web Development, App Development, cybersecurity, Data Analytics, Data Science, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Cross platform compatibility- Being a versatile language, it is supported by various Operating Systems such as Windows, Mac, Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Supports multiple programming paradigms- This is one of the most important capabilities of Python. Users can write codes using procedural, object-oriented or functional styles.\n",
